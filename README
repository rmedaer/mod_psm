Private State Manager module for Apache2

This repository contains a Apache2 module to manage a "Private State". From
HTTP1/1 you can manage a state between requests within a specific domain.
In HTTP protocol, this mechanism is also called "Cookies";
see [RFC6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265). So, by setting cookies
(`Set-Cookie` header) you can put and share a state between in your state-less
API(s). However anything ensure to your server that the client will not modify
the content of these cookies (a.k.a. the state itself).

This "Private State Manager" is a Apache2 module which resolve this issue.
On outgoing request, it will replace data within `Set-Cookies` headers with
a token. When PSM detect a token in `Cookie` header of incoming headers, it
will replace it with data previously set.
